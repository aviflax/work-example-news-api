## Usage Examples

### Create a user

    $ curl -i -X POST -H API-Key:13tm31n -H Content-Type:application/json -d '{"name":"Amanda Hugginkiss", "address":{"zip":"10025"}, "phone":"867-5309"}' http://localhost:5000/users
    HTTP/1.1 201 Created

### Retrieve the news for a user

    $ curl -i -X GET -H API-Key:13tm31n -H Accept:application/json http://localhost:5000/users/1/news
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Sun, 25 Jan 2015 17:15:27 GMT
    Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
    Transfer-Encoding: chunked
    Server: Jetty(7.6.13.v20130916)

    {
      "weather": {
        "forecast": {
            ...lots of keys here...

## Cache Testing

The resource “news for a user” contains data from external services, and can therefore be quite slow. Its implementation therefore uses caching to ensure that it isn’t slow. (This also reduces usage of the external services, which can save money.)

Here’s a primitive approach to confirming that the resource is caching the external data and not retrieving it for every request.

(This assumes a bash shell.)

1. Create a new user resource as above. The below commands assume the user has the ID "1"
2. Warm the cache: `time curl -H API-Key:13tm31n -H Accept:application/json http://localhost:5000/users/1/news`
3. Note the time required for the initial call; it’s generally 700–1200 ms
4. send a bunch of concurrent requests: `ab -c 40 -n 2000 -H API-Key:13tm31n -H Accept:application/json http://localhost:5000/users/1/news`
5. note the median time for all requests; it should be less than 100 ms
